        Physical symptoms are common in depression, and, in fact, vague aches and pain are often the presenting symptoms of depression. These symptoms include chronic joint pain, limb pain, back pain, gastrointestinal problems, tiredness, sleep disturbances, psychomotor activity changes, and appetite changes. A high percentage of patients with depression who seek treatment in a primary care setting report only physical symptoms, which can make depression very difficult to diagnose. Physical pain and depression have a deeper biological connection than simple cause and effect; the neurotransmitters that influence both pain and mood are serotonin and norepinephrine. Dysregulation of these transmitters is linked to both depression and pain. Antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine may be used as first-line treatments in depressed patients who present with physical symptoms. Many physicians consider patients to be in remission when their acute emotional symptoms have abated, but residual symptoms—including physical symptoms—are very common and increase the likelihood of relapse. All symptoms must be measured in order to achieve full remission. There are a number of short yet accurate measurement tools (rating scales) available that effectively measure the remission of physical symptoms as well as emotional symptoms.

    <div class="para">Physical symptoms are common in major depression and may lead to chronic pain and complicate treatment. Symptoms associated with depression include joint pain, limb pain, back pain, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, psychomotor activity changes, and appetite changes. In the primary care setting, a high percentage of patients with depression present exclusively with physical symptoms. Simon et al.1 analyzed a World Health Organization study of somatic symptoms in the presentation of depression. Of the 1146 patients in 14 countries included in the survey who met the criteria for depression, 69% reported only somatic symptoms as the reason for their visit. Unfortunately, depression can often go undiagnosed in these patients, as the physical symptoms associated with depression may be interpreted as symptoms of a somatic illness.
        Patients who present with a high number of physical symptoms may be more likely to have a mood disorder than patients who present with only a few physical symptoms. Kroenke et al.2 studied 1000 adult primary care clinic patients and found that the number of physical symptoms present was highly predictive of mood disorders and functional impairment. In patients who reported 0 or 1 physical symptom, 2% were found to have a mood disorder, but among patients who reported 9 or more physical symptoms, 60% were found to have a mood disorder (Figure 1). Overall, the presence of any physical symptom approximately doubled the likelihood that the patient had a mood disorder.</div>

    <div class="para">In general, the worse the painful physical symptoms, the more severe the depression. Physical symptoms have been found to increase the duration of depressed mood. In a study of chronic pain as a predictor of depressive morbidity in the general population, Ohayon and Schatzberg3 found that of the study participants who reported at least 1 key symptom of depression, those with a chronic painful physical condition reported a longer duration of depressed mood (19.0 months) than those without chronic pain (13.3 months).Numerous studies have shown7–9 that patients with major depression who have residual symptoms after treatment have higher relapse rates and they relapse earlier than do those without residual symptoms. In fact, relapse rates are 3 times higher in individuals who have residual symptoms after they have achieved significant improvement than in individuals with no residual symptoms.8 One may infer, then, that the likelihood of relapse is significantly reduced in patients who attain asymptomatic remission.</div>
